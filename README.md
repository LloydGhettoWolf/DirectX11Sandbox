# DirectX11Sandbox
DirectX 11 Learning exercise

A simple (ish) directX 11 "engine" - the TestProject project of this solution loads the crytek sponza and has a 1000 lights in a normal
unoptimized forward renderer.
Depends on the ObjParser project to create the "Boom" file format for pre-processed .obj file data to load.

This is more or less in disrepair, so use at own risk but let me know of any questions you may have.
